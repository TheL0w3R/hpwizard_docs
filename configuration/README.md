# About configuration files

Config files are generated dynamically by HPWizard's config algorithm.

This allows me to introduce new config values and the plugin will update yout current files without modifying its existing content.

For that reason, entries are not written in any predefined order, this means your generated files could contain entries in a different order. If you're struggling to find a specific entry, use the search function on your text editor!
