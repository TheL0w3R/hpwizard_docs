# Installation

The installation is pretty simple, just place the JAR file in your `/plugins/` directory, restart the server and you're done!

Once the server loads, a folder will be generated on `/plugins/HPWizard/`, this folder contains all the data and config files for the plugin.

To start configuring the plugin, head over to the [Configuration](/configuration/) guide.

## Upgrading from 1.X

HPWizard 2.X architecture is brand new, this means config files, wizard data, wands data and so are stored and managed in a whole different way. For now you'll have to delete your HPWizard 1.X folder before installing HPWizard 2.X.

In the near future, I'll upload a 1.X auxiliary tool to let you dump all your data in a format that HPWizard 2.X can recognize and import.
