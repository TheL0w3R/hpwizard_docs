# Installation

The installation is pretty simple, just place the JAR file in your `/plugins/` directory, restart the server and you're done!

Once the server loads, a folder will be generated on `/plugins/HPWizard/`, this folder contains all the data and config files for the plugin.

To start configuring the plugin, head over to the [Configuration](/configuration/) guide.
